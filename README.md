# moco-cli
**Mo**ney **Co**nverter on the CLI

## Installation
Clone repository  
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Besnn/moco-cli
    ```  




When you type `ls && ls moco-cli` you should have something like this:  
![ls && ls moco-cli](/assets/ls.png)


Open you `.bashrc` now: `nano ~/.bashrc`  


Add `export PATH=<absolute_directory_of_script>:$PATH` (no angle brackets)

You can get the absolute path with `realpath <directory>/moco-cli` while inside moco-cli  
If that doesn't work try `echo $(pwd)`

Finally, type `source ~/.bashrc`
